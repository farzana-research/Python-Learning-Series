# 🎲 Number Guessing Game — Control Flow

This project is part of my Python learning series. It demonstrates how to use **control flow**, **loops**, and **conditionals** in Python by building a simple number guessing game.

---

## 📌 What This Covers

- `if`, `elif`, `else` conditional logic
- `while` loop and loop control
- `random.randint()` for number generation
- Basic `try-except` error handling
- User input with `input()` and `int()`

---

## 🛠️ How to Run

Make sure Python is installed, then run:

```bash
python guessing_game.py
